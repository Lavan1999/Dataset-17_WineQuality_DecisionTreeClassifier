# Wine Quality Data analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Wine Quality Data" using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to wine characteristics and quality, including acidity levels, residual sugar, sulfur dioxide content, density, pH, alcohol percentage, and color. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

## Description
The "Wine Quality Data" dataset contains information about wine characteristics and quality. Each entry represents a wine sample and includes the following columns:

- **fixed_acidity**: Fixed acidity level of the wine.
- **volatile_acidity**: Volatile acidity level of the wine.
- **citric_acid**: Citric acid content in the wine.
- **residual_sugar**: Residual sugar content in the wine.
- **chlorides**: Chlorides content in the wine.
- **free_sulfur_dioxide**: Free sulfur dioxide content in the wine.
- **total_sulfur_dioxide**: Total sulfur dioxide content in the wine.
- **density**: Density of the wine.
- **pH**: pH level of the wine.
- **sulphates**: Sulphates content in the wine.
- **alcohol**: Alcohol percentage in the wine.
- **quality**: Quality rating of the wine.
- **color**: Color of the wine (Red or White).
